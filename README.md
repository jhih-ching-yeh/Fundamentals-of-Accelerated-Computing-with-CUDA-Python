# GPU-Accelerated-Computing-with-Python
NVIDIA’s CUDA Python provides a driver and runtime API for existing toolkits and libraries to simplify GPU-based accelerated processing. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for science, engineering, data analytics, and deep learning applications. However, as an interpreted language, it’s been considered too slow for high-performance computing.
